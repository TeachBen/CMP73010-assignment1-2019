Version Management also called  Version Control or Revision Control, is a means to effectively track and control changes to a collection of related entities.  The term "Versioning" is also sometimes used but the difference is that "Versioning" typically refers to when someone manually applies a version number or label to something for easier communication or simplification such as "draft", "beta", or "1.0".
